## Abstract

Offering route planning advice to travelers is not a goal in itself.
For example, a foldable bike manufacturer wants to sell bikes, a taxi-service wants to drive cars, and a public transit agency wants to sell more tickets; yet all of these players may want to offer a route planner to their customers that take into account all options.
It is not a thriving competitive ecosystem when the different stakeholders need to compete for the best access to data for their route planners instead of competing on the quality of their core business.
As a solution we propose to build a __level playing field__ where everyone has an equal access to both open transport data, as well as the mobility profile of a user.
If we want to achieve that goal, __we need to collaborate cross organizations on three different aspects__: i) standardized Linked Data ontologies for the transport domain, ii) Cost-efficient Web APIs for Open Transport Data that allow for client to automate data adoption over multiple servers, and iii) privacy aware protocols for decentral data pods.
Together with the Flemish mobility company De Lijn, we are working on a serverless JavaScript library that downloads data from the Web while routing called [Planner.js](https://planner.js.org).
